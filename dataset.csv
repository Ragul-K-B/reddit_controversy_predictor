politics,Megathread: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies at 87,"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural, and feminist icon has died. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

politics,Megathread: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Must Turn Over Eight Years Of Personal And Corporate Tax Returns,"A federal judge on Monday rejected a bold argument from President Trump that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, allowing the Manhattan district attorney’s office to subpoena eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax returns.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

But with social media, things are totally different. While Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat still let you just engage with your friends, many others just open up to the public and anyone can engage. Things like Discord, Twitter, and pretty much everything comments section under an online video and online game voice lobbies. Knowing that behind those aren’t codes and pixels but real

unpopularopinion,Being too cold is WAY better than being too warm.,"Random opinion I just thought about from past experiences. By this I don't mean absolutely freezing/sizzling climates, I just mean from *mildly* warmer/colder weather than normal. I've seen myself be really stressed during warmer weather, with no real way to cool myself at all. On the other hand, with colder climates, it's really easy to cool yourself down; get under a warm blanket, get a hot drink and just **vibe** there I guess. It's really comforting too, probably one of the best feelings ever.

Though this doesn't really make sense if you're outdoors and not inside, it's technically inside I'm talking about. Being outside is a whole different story, though it's technically the same answer on that side in my opinion.

unpopularopinion,Coffee Culture Sucks,"I hate, hate, hate coffee culture.  I can't stand people saying, ""Oh, I can't do anything until I get a warm cup of coffee in me.""  Shut up.  Being a former smoker, I recognize the addiction and subsequent irritability of coffee drinkers and it bugs me to no end that caffeine gets glossed over as an addictive substance, or even fucking celebrated to some extent.  Those people who brag about needing 5 expresso shots (sorry, esssspresso) a day need an intervention, not a nod of approval.  Seriously, all you coffee drinkers are the biggest group of fucking enablers I've ever seen.

When doing group activities, like camping, I loathe waiting for others to start their day after a morning ritual that hogs counter space, or propane, or dirties good clean water.

Edit: I should probably point out that I know many school districts have been getting free food. The point of this post is that a lot of people argue that they *shouldn't* be given free food.

To those who do, whether by choice or not, give birth to handicapped children, you have my deepest respect and I don't doubt that parents will do anything in their power to provide the best life for their children and love them the way they are, but i don't think it's wrong to assume that such a life is more emotionally taxing than raising healthy children.

unpopularopinion,A lot of the television shows using fully adult actors in a high school setting could easily change their plot to revolve around a college setting instead of the weird fixation television has on displaying the sex lives of high schoolers,"I think a good example of this is the show Riverdale. If you don’t know, it’s a show using the characters of Archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show. In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). 

In the show, or as much as I’ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people.

I used to dream of becoming an adult and being able to talk to people about philosophy and politics and science and I thought adults were a more elite class who were higher in social standing and ranking than us kids. 

When I reached my late 20s I realized that most adults are just fatter uglier kids. Like, theyre morons. They still dont know anything, many have never even read a book. Theyre dumb af to be honest, fumbling around doing everything wrong. The average adult in the street is dumber than even the most idiotic kid in school, at least the kid has potential.

To read the exact same story, but from a different perspective. I imagine this would be great for the Harry Potter books, as there was so much depth shown in certain characters that it's a shame we only got to read it from Harry's perspective. This idea of ""equals"" would also allow readers to see depth and traits in a character they may not have seen before just by reading the main character's perspective.

unpopularopinion,"Not learning (or worse, not teaching your kids) to swim is one of the absolute stupidest things you could do","Swimming is like walking, but for water. It's part of the few basic means of movement we, humans, have at our disposal, along with running, crawling and climbing. Not knowing how to swim puts you at a HUGE disadvantage, as you pretty much can't avoid water. Any mildly interesting / fun activity might turn into a potentially lethal one, should you not know how to swim. Going fishing? Better not fall into the water...

I know, swimmers can drown too, but if you can't swim, you're guaranteed to have to be rescued.

There are a number of forms of abuse that range from over-parenting, to neglect, over-discipline to straight up negative enabling behavior.

I have friends who don't talk to their parents because the strictness was so suffocating, and friends who don't talk to their parents because they were lazy bums who never took an interest in their child's life.

But, provided that they are actively making something of themselves, be it education, pursuing their passions or something that will eventually lead them to achieve full independence and move out anyway, adding an unnecessary expense to their budget just makes the time they take to get to that point *even longer*.

Since smoking has no medical use (or at least not any that have scientific backing), combined with its high potential for abuse and addiction, it needs to be treated with the severity it deserves.

And don’t give me that bullshit of “smoking doesn’t hurt anybody but the smoker, so piss off”, because second hand smoke definitely exists and can even cause lung cancer in non smokers.

I don’t give a fuck if “ohhh society’s normalized it so it’s too late”, because we’ve changed a lot of normalized things since the last century.

Edit: Changed “tired and sick” to “sick and tired”. In hindsight, no idea why I didn’t write it like that in the first place.

Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes.

I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song.

The news story was basically “How dare a medical professional say such a thing; my baby is perfect to me.” A lot of people called her a “hero” for continuing the pregnancy and giving birth. The baby died before her first birthday. 

If doctors are recommending termination, nature has decided the baby isn’t going to make it. Generally speaking, there are two instances where the parents decide to continue the pregnancy anyway. Either a) the parents are in total denial about the situation and are pretending it isn’t happening or b) the parents are putting their ideology/religious beliefs first. It is truly sad and horrible when babies die in this way, no one should ever have to go through this, but it is delaying the inevitable and forcing your child to needlessly suffer is cruel and selfish.

IVF clinics trash more fertilized eggs a year than abortion clinics. The entire process is them fertilizing a certain amount of eggs, transplanting the ones least likely to have genetic problems into the mother, and tossing the rest and/or freezing them and then tossing them later if the parents decide not to try again. If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.

It’s also way more difficult to quit than most people think, especially if you’ve made it a daily habit.

If you do not have access to clean or drinkable water this absolutely doesn't apply.

unpopularopinion,Most people have literally no clue what communism actually is.,"I will start by saying that I'm not the expert either, proving the point. 

I'm using the United States as the basis for this argument since in my country Portugal, we have a Communist Party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party - it's basically impossible at this moment and they have 7/8% or less every election. 

But in the US I come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are. Socialism isn't equal to communism. Also, ""everything I disagree with"" isn't communism. You are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesn't want to hear ""no"" more often than none.

I would even argue that most people can't even point if a political idea is mostly left or right-wing.

No shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. It's just how things were. Despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

It's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. We would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

unpopularopinion,Gaming is a healthier medium for young adults than Social Media and YouTube in terms of mental health,"Gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive.

Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.

Social Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses.

Which makes sense. If you couldn't care any less, means you care as little as is humanly possible. You can't care any less.

However, Americans say that they COULD care less but with the same intentions in using the phrase. If you COULD care less, surely that means you do actually care? Like, there is room to care less.

Dunno, just bugs the hell out of me.

If you’re making your kids pay rent, treat their room and property like a real landlord would and anyone who doesn’t should face legal penalties.

I also believe that once kids are being charged rent, they should be free to make their own decisions, eg. Going out whenever they want or inviting friends over.

unpopularopinion,People who hate children are annoying and cringey.,"I'm not talking about people who just don't want kids. That's your personal preference and I respect that. It's the people who tell you constantly that they hate ""nasty little crotch goblins"" and feel the need to express their hatred any time a child is nearby. Or make some disgusted face when someone is holding a baby. 

You don't look cool. You look like a fucking asshole. Children are people too. And depending on age you can really mess with the way they see themselves if they hear you express how much you hate them and how disgusting you think they are. Like bro chill the fuck out. Let the kids be kids and keep your shitty opinion to yourself. Just say you don't want kids and be done with it. No need to go on and on about how much you hate them and what you think of them.

Now I agree with making your kids, once they have a job, paying part of the rent to the landlord, chip in, etc., but that's everyone in the family working together.

Look, I understand why you don't want your teens to be sexually active so young. But that's the problem, they're young and dumb. They have urges and hormones. They don't always think about all the consequences of their decisions. 

If they trust you enough to come to you and ask something like this and you turn them down because you don't want them to have sex, youre just screwing both of you. Think back to when you were a teen, if you *really* wanted to do something and your parents said ""no"" , were you immediatly going to accept the answer?

unpopularopinion,Being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.,"People should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. My first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven’t done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

Edit: A couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn’t be proud of your family. That doesn’t apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. This extends to your community. What I am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

Another point I’d like to make is if you agree that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn’t be proud either. Current Mongols don’t need to feel ashamed of Ghengis Khan. I don’t think modern Germans should be held responsible for Hitler. That also means they shouldn’t get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

I have a guy friend who’s celibate but his friend group bullied him, called him (gay slurs) until he caved in to the peer pressure.

Even winter is better. It’s the holidays and lights but also snow is gorgeous. It’s nice to just bundle up when it’s cold and have some hot chocolate or coffee. I’m more inclined to leave the house in the winter time than the summer time.

It baffles me when people say “oh yeah I LOVE it when it’s hot. I love it when it’s in the 90’s.” For those of you using Celsius, it’s between 33 and 38. Like what is wrong with you????

unpopularopinion,Infertile couples should just adopt instead of making a big fuss trying to make a miracle baby,"Every time I hear of fertility struggles online, or see posts about people going through rounds of IVF and the ensuing emotional trauma of miscarriages, It kind of disgusts me.



I also work for a major insurer and know that fertility treatments are driving up everyone else's premiums because they're considered necessary care. Sorry, but I disagree.



It's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system.
I think it's completely entitled and self-absorbed to think that somehow your miracle baby is worth more or deserves more love than any one of those infants. 



I know adoption can be hard, and that it should be made easier for the sake of children finding good homes, but you can't tell me adopting is harder than 4 rounds of IVF and multiple miscarriages. I've seen friends go through that mess and at the end they are different people.

Most of the time, kids don't even understand the significance, and they are routinized into it.

Here's the thing though, at least my my own personal experiences and that of my female friends and coworkers over the years:  Women usually prefer compliments from other women more than ones from men (unless of course they already have a relationship with that man).  When a man compliments you, you don't know if he did so with any expectations.

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems.

(Potential Spoilers Ahead) Some of the movies I found most memorable are movies like No Country For Old Men, Avengers Infinity War, Se7en, Fight Club, Hannibal etc etc. These movies are all super memorable to me not only because they're good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end. Now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything, I just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it.

unpopularopinion,Basic handyman and repair skills should be taught in high school.,"Just basic stuff like sewing, how to properly and safely install shelves and furniture, fixing basic plumbing issues, how to safely use power tools and regular tools, and most of all, how to troubleshoot problems.

We should be taught to use our own intuition and plan out repairing things. It genuinely makes me feel confident and proud whenever I can fix something up, even if it's a simple task. We should also be taught when it's time to call in a professional.

We can have sheer capes for summer and spring, wool and velvet for fall and winter. Capes can spread to each and every corner of the globe. I mean, you could have one for every outfit.

But I watched the video and thought: he did nothing wrong here. He MIGHT have intended to ""show off"" the \~$60 he put in the plate...but he could have just been checking how much was in his hand or fidgeting as anyone else would do. He certainly could afford to give more, but many people don't give as much money as normal (or any at all--which is fine!) when they are visiting a church. Nothing he did in the video was objectionable, and yet the article took a bunch of shots at him based on how he held his money, how little he gave, what may have been going on in his mind--a bunch of cheap shots, but more importantly, all regarding something pretty insignificant.

changemyview,CMV: Off-duty cops are just civilians and should have none of the legal protections of being a cop for their actions.,"Off-duty cops are just regular people who are not at work. Whatever actions they do should be viewed legally as a civilian doing them. There is no reason why the legal protections of being a cop should extend to their activities off duty actions. If someone is in danger/breaking the law, they should intervene as a civilian, meaning they have no legal responsibility to provide aid or execute the law. If an off-duty cop kills someone, it should be treated as if that person where a civilian who killed someone. I am not arguing whether or not the actions of off duty cops are right or wrong, just that those actions are not special and should face the same legal scrutiny as any other civilian.

My understanding is that most high school curriculums cover algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and for advanced students, pre-calculus or calculus. I'm not aware of a national standard that requires statistics.

For most people, algebra - geometry - trigonometry are rarely if ever used after they leave school. I believe that most students don't even see how they might use these skills, and often mock their value.

Basic statistics can be used almost immediately and would help most students understand their world far better than the A-G-T skills. Simply knowing concepts like Standard Deviation can help most people intuitively understand the odds that something will happen. Just the rule of thumb that the range defined by average minus one standard deviation to the average plus one standard deviation tends to cover 2/3's of the occurrences for normally distributed sets is far more valuable than memorizing SOH-C",19483,0.9,1303,0.0067,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kb6khu/cmv_statistics_is_much_more_valuable_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kb6khu/cmv_statistics_is_much_more_valuable_than/

China needs to be held accountable and we need to send the message that this isn’t ok.

Reasoning:

Animal abuse is a horrible thing. Animals should be treated with kindness and respect, for they are living beings as well. Anyone who chooses to treat an animal with cruelty, abuse, and pain is disgusting. 

However, slaughtering animals in order to eat them does not fall into the category of “abuse.” 

For example, let’s say there is a cow. This cow leads a healthy life with plenty of food, water, and all it needs to survive. Once it’s old enough, it gets killed in a painless, humane way and turned into steak.

Rather it's about the current leadership of the republican party, which I'll simply refer to as the GOP.

My thesis is this: the GOP has known for some several decades that it's voter base is shrinking. It's response has increasingly been to target the systems and institutions underpinning democracy. During the Trump presidency at the latest the GOP has decided to take the next step and interfere in the elections directly to stay in power.

The GOP has known for some decades that demographic trends do not favor it's traditional base. Faced with that, there have been repeated debates about whether it's appeal needs to broaden. However, time and again the decision was made to focus on the already highly mobilised core voters rather than try to open up. The tea party movement has given the latest big push in that direction.

I believe that overweight or even underweight people should very much be part of the body positive movement and should remain that way. However they should not be the figurehead of the movement as a whole.

As I have found before, many people use the body positive movement as a excuse for not striving to change their BMI or their possibly fatal circumstances. A persons body weight, as I have found can at the very least be helped.

On the other hand, people who do not have control over their circumstances with their own body (someone with Down syndrome or people with other visible disabilities beyond their control etc.) often are not seen as a major part of the movement despite needing the support that the movement has to offer.

The reason I say 25, is because that is the age that your frontal lobe is fully formed. And becuase of that you are able to make rational decisions.

You have been an adult for nearly a decade, and have had plenty of time to think about what you want or don't want in life, including if you do or don't want children.

[One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923482/) found that 42% of declawed cats had ongoing long-term pain and about a quarter of declawed cats limped. In up to 15% of cases, the claws can eventually regrow after the surgery.

This is because the fine is not a payment for an item, it's supposed to be a punishment and a deterrent. If someone with no income has to pay a £50 fine, versus someone with millions in the bank, the amount of punishment they're experiencing will be vastly different, even though they've done the same thing. I think in this situation it makes more sense to balance the level of punishment, than to have the same arbitrary cash amount.

In a criminal trial, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to demonstrate beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant committed a certain crime. Cases of police killing are currently framed as the officer (defendant) against the state (prosecution). However, police officers are a part of the legal system, just on the ""enforcement"" side. To allow officers to carry guns implicitly grants them approval to kill in situations in which they consider it necessary to do so. These situations are analagous to a death row trial in which the officer is the prosecution and the victim is the defendant.

Users can now consume only information that comports with their worldview, and thus, the hatred towards the ""other side"" has grown exponentially.

Violence, or the threat of violence, is punished more harshly when there is more weight behind it. For instance, the difference between simple battery and aggravated battery generally includes the use of a deadly weapon, even if the injury sustained by the victim is the same.

The actions of on-duty police officers have the implicit backing of the state, which has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. In the same way that it is worse to commit a crime with a deadly weapon than it is to commit that same crime without one, it is also worse to commit a crime while leveraging the power of the state than it is to commit the same crime without leveraging that power.

changemyview,CMV: Anyone who votes for Trump is completely lacking in moral fiber because they are voting for a known rapist,"Ever since the court found that Trump raped Jean Carroll and ordered him to pay a restitution fee for defaming her when he said he didn't rape her, Donald Trump should have been automatically disqualified as a candidate because no one would vote for him. Rape is one of the ugliest crimes imaginable and it speaks to the core of someone's character. Only a monster can rape someone. If you knowingly elect a monster who raped someone, you have no moral character.

I hear people say, shit like ""I'm voting Trump because I think he'll be better for the economy"". So if someone raped you, you went to court told everyone about it, it was publicly acknowledged and became common knowledge that that person raped you, you would have no problem with them becoming president as long as the economy did well? Is that what you're saying? Or because that's just a hypothetical and you personally weren't the one who was raped, you just don't care?

Lately I’ve been struggling, as a white person, to read tweets/opinion pieces where people of color lump all white people together in a negative statement. Today I saw someone tweet a picture of a trump rally with a caption to the effect of “it doesn’t matter how much info comes out about the president being a scumbag, white people will always support the oppression of blacks no matter what”. 

I know they’re not talking about allies like me, but I still feel hurt and challenged by these statements. No matter how much I protest, donate, and spread awareness, some people will still see that I’m white and associate me with people who oppose my view.

Both she and I saw no reason for them to be labeled, and that them being gender neutral would have no adverse effects.

But I might be wrong. I am only looking at this from my limited view point.

Racism should be solved by building up minorities’ rights and banding together so that everyone has equal opportunity, no matter their race. This won’t happen if there are casual jokes making fun of white people.

Imagine if the example I gave in the first paragraph had the roles switched. Imagine if it was a confused white man reading the newspaper and the meme was captioned “black people”. I have no doubts that this would not sit well at all with people.

Now at first glance, yes that may be the heart of what happened. But of course, deep down a lot of other factors were at play: John's SO getting fat was a gradual process which reflected her level of comfort in a relationship she thought was stable and set for life. She had done all the hard work - winning over John - and now that they have moved in together, and had discussions about marriage and possibly kids, she (subconsciously or not) thought she could finally 'let it go' and not have to try so hard.

changemyview,CMV: White people with dreadlocks is not cultural appropriation,"I’m sure this is going to trigger some people but let me explain why I hold this view.

Firstly, I am fairly certain that white people in Ancient Greece, the Celts, Vikings etc would often adopt the dreadlock style, as they wore their hair ‘like snakes’ so to speak. Depending on the individual in questions hair type, if they do not wash or brush their hair for a prolonged period of time then it will likely go into some form of dreads regardless.

Maybe the individual just likes that particular hairstyle, if anything they are actually showing love and appreciation towards the culture who invented this style of hair by adopting it themselves.

I’d argue that if white people with dreads is cultural appropriation, you could say that a man with long hair is a form of gender appropriation. 

At the end of the day, why does anyone care what hairstyle another person has? It doesn’t truly affect them, just let people wear their hair, clothes or even makeup however they want.

Neeson talks about how the character is ultimately lead into a life of criminality and violence by his thirst for revenge, very explicitly framing this as a negative thing. In being asked by the interviewer how he channels that emotion to play the character, he tells a story. He says 40 years ago, a close friend of his was brutally raped, and in asking about who the rapist was discovered they were black. He then says he went around for a week in black neighborhoods hoping some ""black bastard"" would start a fight with him so he could kill them, any random black person.

There is effectively no way the man (or any older candidate) could possibly be in touch with the issues facing most of the country. This is only going to become a larger and larger divide as time goes on and quicker advances in technology create larger gaps of understanding between age groups.

75% of Americans may identify as some form of Christian, but to base policy (on a state or federal level) *solely* on majority rule is inherently un-American. The fact that there is no law establishing a “national religion”, whether originally intended or not, means that all minority religious groups have the American right to practice their faith, and by extension have the right to practice no faith.

A government’s (state or federal) policies should always reflect the doctrine under which IT operates, not the doctrine of any one particular religion.

If there is a freedom to practice ANY religion, and an inverse freedom to practice NO religion, any state or federal government is duty-bound to either represent ALL religious doctrines or NONE at all whatsoever.

*there is nothing wrong with assuming someone’s gender* the vast majority of people (especially in Western culture) are not in the LGBTQ+ spectrum, and even within those that are, people that are gender non-conforming are a small minority. These people makeup such a small percentage of the population that they are rare. Given this assuming someone that presents as male/female  is assuming something that is going to be the case in 90%+ of instances, so assuming that someone falls into the largest category is not wrong, but is safe. For most of modern history (correct me if I am wrong on that) and majorly observable instances of society, we have only known two genders (though evidence suggest some societies recognize a third, i.e. Thailand ladyboys and in South America some cultures historically recognized transgender people).

Girls will see themselves as objects. Boys will start to view girls as objects. Both will get unhealthy kinks and fetishes. Relationships will depend on sex. Children will be losing their virginity wayyyy too early, and they won’t have condoms because their sex ed class isn’t providing them, and they’re too scared of their toxic religious parents to buy/get them.

When Job questions God's motive for ruining his life, and ending the lives of many close to him, he is merely scolded.

I know many people will say, ""well, like it or not, you're an adult at 18."" But we've determined as a society, in the US at least, that some adults (i.e., those under 21) cannot consume alcohol or cannabis (and even tobacco now in many places); thus, we already have exceptions when it comes to liberties one enjoys at age 18. This isn't without precedent. And just so it's explicit, I think this should apply to all genders.

I am making this argument for three main reasons. First, on a societal level, I think having 18 and 19 year olds in the sex work industry promotes ephebophilia in our culture (think about the popularity of the search term ""teen"" across many porn platforms...). Raising the age to 21 would at least reduce this widespread fantasy of someone ""fresh out of high school.""

Background: When I was 18 in college, I registered to vote through my friend, he was one of those ppl that ask you to register to vote. He asked if I could register to vote as a republican, so my friend would get commission. I said sure, I figured I could change parties later if I needed to. It struck me as odd that a political party incentivized this.

Over the years I’ve come to dislike both political parties. I agree with views of some of the parties, but hate a lot of cool kids/nonsense drama/gate keeping that comes with “being part of any party.” This extra cool kids/nonsense and gatekeeping distracts from the real issues and in my opinion blurs the real motive of why parties do what they do.

But a gun in the hands of an ill-informed, poorly educated, jittery, person who has never in their life been in a high-pressure, life-threatening situation where they had to act fast and decisively can make a bad situation more chaotic and dangerous. So I'm putting forth the idea that anyone who wants to get a concealed carry license (or even anyone who wants to own a gun) should have to attend a training course to learn how to do just that (as well as gun safety). And if they don't pass it, they aren't able to get that gun/concealed carry license. Just like a driving test.

changemyview,CMV: Tying politicians salaries to the median income of their constituents would help incentivize them to work for their economic benefit,"In the private sector, pay structures that include performance bonuses or commissions are popular for jobs where the employer wants to incentivize effective and productive job performance. Even if it was not 1:1, having the pay of government leaders be derived from the median income of the population that they work for would directly drive their interests in raising that metric as significantly as possible. Want a raise? Pursue one for your constituents.

Glad to hear criticisms of this idea as it’s only a starting point, but I feel that it’s possible to find a structural basis that would decrease the pandering to special interests and benefit the population in a completely reasonable manner.

I see no reason for having kids say those words unless you're trying to just get them to become a swarm of little Patriots who see nothing wrong with their country. This is a toxic and harmful way to think because they won't be able to fix problems cuz they won't see any.

Tradition is a big part of many American families, but what's the point of hanging on to such a little thing? Most people I know don't care for the pledge, they never even gave a second thought to it. So I don't see the point of keeping on saying it every day.

It could in previous years, but inflation continued while minimum wage itself remained static. Instead of constantly debating and painfully raising minimum wage bit by bit when politicians finally agree to, why isn't it at a set ratio depending on a formula that factors inflation and potentially also the average living cost in a state? It seems simpler. I could just look up ""whats minimum wage today?"" like I would the worth of a USD.

Problem 1: Straw-manning 

Two people cannot have a meaningful debate when they do not understand the other person's position. I'll choose a nice, non-controversial topic to demonstrate this: abortion. 

The pro-life opposes abortion because they think it is morally wrong to end a life and that fetuses constitute a life. They don't all agree about all the circumstances and they have a variety of arguments for this, but at the core that is their position. 

The pro-choice side has two distinct stances: 1. abortion is not wrong because a fetus is not a life/does not trump a woman's bodily autonomy or 2. Legalized abortion is a lesser evil when compared to the ramifications of making it illegal. 

Of course people don't actually argue about these positions.

He talks about the fact that Apu should be made less of a stereotype and given more character development e.g. via getting ownership of the Kwik-E-Mart, as well as not having racist undertones e.g. Hank Azaria voicing him, being replaced by a South Asian actor instead. Also worth pointing out here and now (not that it should change anything) that I'm also of South Asian ethnicity, living in the UK.

So my view is this: focusing on the ""Apu problem"" entirely misses the wider point on racism and stereotypes.

Many people will complain about the uselessness of knowledge you learn in school, but I think general use information (such as historical and scientific literacy) are important enough to a person's perspective of the world for it to be warranted to be taught.

What I'm talking about is the very basic way of teaching which essentially follows this base format:

1. Teacher explains to a class of children the material

2. Children are tested on their knowledge of this material in  a test, where they are graded based on how much they know (not necessarily understand),

3. Grades can then determine a child's possibilities in life (whether they pass, whether they qualify for further education, competitions, etc.)

Trump may sound more coherent in a sense but he’s dodging questions left and right, which is a terrible look, and while Biden is giving more coherent answers to a degree, it sounds like he just woke up from a nap and can be hard to understand sometimes. 

So, it seems like our main choices for president are someone who belongs in a retirement home, not the White House (Biden), and a convicted felon (Trump). While the ideas of either person may be good or bad, they are easily some of the worst messengers for those ideas.

Once the contracts ran out, though, Big Anchovy wasn't doing so well since pizza places weren't ordering any more. But what's worse, anchovy pizza's been totally demonized and no one... NO ONE is buying it anymore.

The last thing Big Anchovy needs is their respective brands being hated on. So they come up with an ingredient that could never work and start marketing it: pineapple.

3. Media companies make a ton of money from these highly viewed events. They also own the rights to all the footage, making it inaccessible to many.

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety.

There are lots of ways you could raise your temperature a little (or a lot if you’re not careful), such as showers, baths, hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas, etc... 

My understanding is that a fever helps fight infection by acting in two ways. The higher temperature inhibits the bug’s ability to reproduce in the body, and it also makes some cells in our immune system more effective at fighting the infection.

The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System.

askscience,Has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?,"Lately I've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading Flatland, etc.

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them?

askscience,Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

The James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.

For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospher",6908,0.96,961,0.0056,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rhpba8/askscience_ama_series_were_experts_working_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rhpba8/askscience_ama_series_were_experts_working_on_the/

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

askphilosophy,How do you avoid allowing philosophy to paralyze your ability to say anything about anything?,"My initial goal in studying philosophy was to clarify and edify my thoughts and beliefs. I wanted to open my mind to new ideas and be able to articulate those ideas effectively to others. 


But ive found that as ive exposed myself to all sorts of new and contradicting ideas, I feel unable to hold a position or narrative or approach with any degree of certainty. I also have a hard time making claims or stating what I personally believe to others, because I feel disingenuous or close-minded in doing so, knowing that there are plenty of credible arguments against what i am saying.


Basically my dilemma can be summed up in a quote from Mark Twaine: ""Education is the pathway from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty."" Maybe it's like the Dunning-Kruger effect?

Even if we knew for sure that God was real, we could still easily choose not to listen to him and do whatever we want anyway. It doesn’t make any sense to me that God doesn’t want anyone to go to hell, yet does not reveal his existence to us so that we can have faith instead, thereby guaranteeing that at least some people will go to hell because there’s no way to be completely sure who God is or what he wants. I don’t see how he could benefit from that, or how we could.

Have modern feminists just quietly abandoned gender constructivism? If not, how can one argue that gender, especially womanhood, is an actively oppressive construct that females are subjected to through gendered socialisation whilst simultaneously regarding transgender womanhood as meaningful or identical to cisgender womanhood?

Is it common, in the modern world, to find notes or writings of famous philosophers centuries after they were written?

askphilosophy,Why is materialism so popular in spite of hard problem of consciousness?,"I'm a physicist without any formal education in philosophy. In my particular field, we're using quantum mechanics (namely Density Functional Theory) to model materials and describe their properties. From a theoretical perspective, it is possible to model an arbitrarily complex system starting from first principles. In principle, we could even model the human brain using known physics. 

Of course, modeling the brain would come at a huge computational cost and is impossible in practice. Nevertheless, one should still find it conceivable that such a model could predict certain processes in the brain that lead to various behavior of humans.

What is utterly inconceivable to me is how such a model could ever predict the subjective experience itself, i.e., the emergence of consciousness. I just don't see how the subjective experience could ever arise from physical processes as we know them.

2. Postmodernism as a product of late capitalism originated in discussions about architectures (as pastiche erasing historical context) and later in media, both of which were the main domains of this president before being elected (eg Trump Tower, The Apprentice).
3. He doesn't argue this but Foucault was often credited with suggesting truth is a product of power, which was probably intended as a critique, but now appears to be something his right-wing party has embraced as a foundational form of legal jurisprudence, eg knowingly arguing law in bad faith is expected and is the superior approach to justice.

They claim philosophy is fucked because papers such as this create absurd non-problems -a thought experiment about sideways music refutes Einstein’s theories of spacetime- and then, given the legitimacy conferred by publication, a cottage industry of responses to the non-problem emerges.

I wouldnt call myself a full-on antinatalist, but it seems to me that when we impose risks on others we need to have a good reason to do so. For people who have fallen unconscious etc there’s good reason to gamble with their lives, but when it comes to people who don’t exist yet, there’s no way they can be created for their own benefit.

How did Japanese philosophy responded to capitalism that introduced high level of individualism?","Sorry for the broad stroke use of the term; I don't mean to simplify ""Japanese philosophy"" as a monolithic entity!

Anyway, this idea of self in Japanese philosophy I got from a lecture and the speaker directed me Bret Davis' Handbook of Japanese Philosophy, but the book doesn't address what I'm going to ask.

Basically the argument about self in Japanese philosophy goes like this (paraphrased):

> Western philosophy has always focused on the notion of ""being"", with the idea that your ""true self"" resides within yourself. On the other hand, Japanese philosophy focus on relationality,^ that is, your ""true self"" is defined in relation to others. If you suffer from a breakup, from example, your ""self"" is not intact, because your *relation* with your significant other was broken. This is why in Japanese society other people is what defines what your self is.

askphilosophy,Why does Camus reject suicide as valid response to the Absurd?,">Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of  ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.

Taken from this Wiki [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). I would like to understand why suicide cannot be considered a valid counter to the Absurd? In understanding that one's life is absurd, why shouldn't suicide be considered an option when taken into account the amount of suffering that one experiences. If meaning cannot be found in this suffering, shouldn't it be possible to give up life as a solution?

But with land, it is a different story as no human can claim to have created it. The land on our planet has always been there, even long before humans settled down. So how can any one person justify owning it, claiming exclusive rights and even forbidding others to walk on it?

If you ask present-day landowners how they justify their ownership, they will likely give you one of the following answers:

1. I got it from someone else through purchase, inheritance or as a gift.

We never know what they really mean—that is to say, we never know what they view as hunger. My idea of hunger is based on experiences studies etc and yours is based on your own separate experiences and studies on hunger.

Otherwise the concepts of male and female gender wouldn't really have any meaning. Saying, for example, 'I identify as a woman', seems to be the same thing as saying, 'I want to exhibit traits that are commonly associated with the female sex'. But there is nothing which intrinsically links the female gender and the female sex, because gender is something that (I think) we have invented to explain the preponderence of certain traits in men and certain traits in women. It seems to me that traits, as in character traits, the things that make up your identity, are not at all linked to sex, or at least not necessarily. If this is the case, then surely gender identity is a meaningless term, because there is no sex for it to be derived from?

What follows are some inarticulate, general musings about romance.

Thinking about romance for me involves the interplay of a family of related concepts that need disentangling– things like love, attraction, desire, intimacy and tenderness; but these are usually deployed as synonyms for romance, in what often proves itself to be a terribly confusing endeavour to try and define what romance might mean in the first place.

I won't try to do that now since this has now become a source of perpetual confusion to me which incredibly, there exists no satisfying, even tentative answer yet (at least I haven't found any)

What I will say, is that I find it difficult to think about why romantic relationships are socially desirable (as sources of companionship and fulfilment). A romantic relationship is only one *form* of relationship, and one that escapes definitional clarity since the admittedly indeterminate concept of romance becomes subsumed and contained within it, with the instance of su",183,0.97,41,0.0067,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/kkf0q7/the_philosophy_of_romance_why_are_romantic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/kkf0q7/the_philosophy_of_romance_why_are_romantic/

David had to lie to family members in order to follow his dream and even though everything is now settled, the atmosphere is terrible. His mother said that he wasted his life. 

Their arguments are:
-He will change his mind and stop liking philosophy after studying it
-He will never find a job (David wants to be a philosophy teacher for now)
-(About him wanting a teacher) he will find it too hard
-Philosophy is too vague to be understood or studied
-David was good at science so he should have studied this

askphilosophy,Why is suffering bad?,"This question kept me up most of last night. I know that suffering *is* bad but only because it *feels* bad. That is, the reason that suffering is bad is that the experience of it is unpleasant, or, in itself, suffering. So suffering is bad because suffering is bad. It doesn't make sense because some suffering is good, like exercising or donating bone marrow. So if some suffering is good and some bad, how do we differentiate?

Maybe with a line to a positive outcome: donating bone marrow leads to something positive so it's suffering with a purpose. But then we could also argue that we can't know all the variables in all instances, and many examples of suffering, which aren't considered acceptable, inadvertently lead to positive outcomes. Like breaking your leg and being excluded from conscription.

So why is suffering bad?

Then I got to thinking about the kinds of suffering.

But it seems that a lot of philosophers who actuary study this stuff believe it is possible to reach moral truths through reasoning.

The way I see it, if an action causes undeniable harm - eg kicking babies - then it's pretty safe to say that it' s morally wrong. But when you get to more complicated topics like abortion, both sides have a point and suddenly I'm not convinced that there is a moral truth.

Kinda like how Disney still wants to make a new Black Panther movie after their main actor died.

The dilemma is broken down into these main questions:

1. **Why is virtual murder in games widely accepted but virtual pedophilia is universally condemned?**
   - For example, most people feel comfortable playing violent video games where you kill enemies, but the idea of a game where you commit pedophilic acts would be met with strong moral outrage.

2. **Is there a consistent moral reasoning to justify this difference?**
   - If both are purely fictional and don’t harm real people, why is one considered more morally acceptable than the other? Are there intrinsic differences between these actions, or is it a cultural or psychological bias?

askphilosophy,Does Camus really avoid taking the Leap of Faith?,"Hi everyone,

I recently finished *The Myth Of Sisyphus* by Camus and found it to be an interesting, yet difficult read. I am scratching my head a bit when reflecting on whether Camus truly avoids committing his self-termed ""Leap of Faith"".

Camus explains that existentialists who ascribe their own subjective meanings to life do so to assuage the distress arising from the absurd condition, and are therefore taking the Leap. 

To the contrary, a true absurd man will continually revolt against this lack of meaning by pursuing (quantitatively) what he values in life.  In other words, live a life rich in as much experience as possible.

What is glaring to me, is that Camus seems to be smuggling in a subjective meaning of life here. The implied argument seems to be: *the meaning of life is to revolt against its meaninglessness*. I'm having trouble seeing how he differs from other existentialists he criticizes as taking the Leap of Faith. Perhaps I am missing something?

I think this answer is very dissatisfying because I disagree with the premise that people practicing beastiality do it for sadistic reasons, I sadly actually know that most feel genuine connections to the animal or do it because they lack other sex opportunities.

I also think the main reason beastiality is almost universally illegal and very much looked down upon is because of religious reasons and because it's considered disgusting, rather than ethical reasons.

I think the biggest ethical problem is obviously that animals can't give consent. But they can't consent to being killed for meat either. And the latter is more cruel.

askphilosophy,Overcoming Nihilism,"I've been struggling with moral and existential nihilistic thoughts recently.

I also know that, from personal experience, I've usually done most of my overthinking during bouts of anxiety, depression, and being stuck in abusive scenarios. Furthermore, as someone who reads a lot of philosophy, the certainty other people tend to display sometimes disorients me -- as if they have access to some intuition, some sense that makes things clearer to them than to I. It can tend to be frustrating, and I cannot tell whether I am taking something obvious and fragmenting it unfairly, or whether there is some sense to what I am doing.

He uses the story of Adam and Eve as his launching point, and posits that the feeling of anxiety comes about right before a decision. Kierkegaard talks about different kinds of anxiety. For instance, there is anxiety about ""fate,"" which affects a forward thinking ""genius"" who is fixated on the consequences of his actions.

Moral Realism

Physicalism (about mind)

But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can't control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem; it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don't have the humility to submit to a civil rule, and therefore you have to control what people think...*

Under this framework, same-sex is disqualified as being a legitimate form of marriage because they can't procreate. 

This suggests that as far as Ben's secular view of marriage is concerned, it exists (or should exist) as a civil and legal union with the express purpose of benefiting ""the state"" or perhaps more broadly, society, by increasing the population and raising the youth in standard nuclear families. 

I see several problems with this.

The first is the response given by the college student he's debating which is ""once your kids grow up and leave the house, will you get divorced, having fulfilled the purpose of marriage?

I don’t think this logic is flawed in a vacuum, but I also don’t think that the idea at the core of the argument accurately represents the world we inhabit. There are plenty of people who suffer and die in natural disasters or from diseases, which have nothing to do with the moral or immoral actions of human beings.

This has been said before and is not original but I do welcome reading recommendations. 

What I do think is original (at least I haven't read any objection like this) is that in modern society, even as an adult, one cannot terminate the contract. The classic response is that if you don't like it, you can leave the society and not engage in the social contract (living a wild life in the woods or something). But in modern society, this possibility no longer exists.

Is the work of building a more ethical framework that isn't MMR pointless if you don't use force to make people adopt it? (Or at least kick out those who believe in MMR)?

The filmmaker later says rather glibly  “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later,”

Oh really? Ethics *after* we do something seems to be the preference when we do anything with technology these days.

So is it ethical to deepfake the dead? Does it matter that its a public figure such as Bourdain? Can deepfakes be justified under ""creative"" or ""artistic license""?

I am familiar with plato's argument in the republic that justice is beneficial to the individual and society as a whole, but I don't really find it all that convincing (as grounds for cleaning that justice is ""good"" and injustice is ""bad""), so I am more interested in theories that don't rely on self-benefit (Or perhaps something more convincing than plato).",149,0.86,153,0.1428,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l57zlp/how_can_morals_exist_without_religion/,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l57zlp/how_can_morals_exist_without_religion/

Would that fall under an appeal to authority? I think it is always better to understand the science and data behind something, but we can't all be experts in every field. If a Biologist were to argue against biblical creationism and use proof of evolution as evidence, could they also use evidence from geologists and astronomers to prove the world is older than 5000 years even if they don't entirely understand how they came to that conclusion? Or is that an appeal to authority from saying ""the consensus of the geological community is that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old"".

Even if this theory had significance as a stepping stone the modern understanding of chemistry, it wouldn't be as significant or as valuable as talking about modern chemistry and the actually physicals laws and equations.

Otherwise how could you convince me to perform the action? Even if it is just because it will satisfy my curiosity and it's fun to do, isn't that still hedonistic?

In fact, it seems to me like if you perform any action it's because you have some motivation to do it, which means you _want_ to do it for some reason.

Amidst these waves of information, we as historians want our readers to remember the following: 

Police brutality against Black people is woven into the fabric of the history of policing in the US—and reflects the historical reality that white America benefits from police and state violence against the Black community. George Floyd’s murder and the brutal suppression of the ensuing protests are the latest in a long history of police brutality and excessive, extraordinary violence. 

As historians like Edward Ayers and Sam Mitrani have established, the construct of American policing was formed between roughly 1840-1880 on the crest of two trends.

AskHistorians,The Atlanta-Area Murders Were Racially Motivated: A Short History of Anti-Asian Racism in North America,"*From the* r/AskHistorians *mod team:*

On Tuesday, 16 March 2021, eight people were murdered in a series of attacks on massage parlors in and around Atlanta, Georgia (United States). Six of these victims were women of Asian descent. Their names are Daoyou Feng (冯道友), Hyun Jung Grant (김현정), Suncha Kim (김순자), Soon Chung Park (박순정), Xiaojie “Emily” Tan (谭小洁), and Yong Ae Yue (유용애). Two others, Delaina Ashley Yaun and Paul Andre Michels, were also murdered on Tuesday evening.

The brutality of these crimes has been met with expressions of shock and dismay across the globe; however, the Atlanta-area attacks are hardly unprecedented. Since the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, over four thousand incidents of anti-Asian violence have been reported across Canada and the United States.^(\[1\]) While it is easy to ascribe the xenophobic hatred that fueled these attacks to the impact of Trumpian rhetoric, it is important to understand that the sentiments underpinning that rhetoric first originated",8091,0.82,270,0.006,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m9bmbq/the_atlantaarea_murders_were_racially_motivated_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m9bmbq/the_atlantaarea_murders_were_racially_motivated_a/

AskHistorians,I think there is a slave grave on my property (GA). How can I confirm this and where should I go to find a local expert?,"I'm in rural center GA.  We bought a large farm out here 8 years ago that had been in the same family since pre-civil war.

The prior owners told us there was a small family grave site on the property but it had been lost to nature over the years and the could only generally point to the area where it was located.

Over the years we have cleared a lot of the land for horse trails and we found the grave site.  There is one large obelisk headstone of a 17yo girl.  Historical records show she died during childbirth of her second child.  The grave stone is pretty elaborate with a long psalm carved in one side.  The other shows that she was born in 1840 and died in 1857.

While we were clearing the area we found near the grave a depression in the ground that is the size of a grave.  There is a smooth stone set at one end that has no writing on it but does look like it was placed there.

Some locals that were helping clear the land swear that it is a slave grave.

Movie theaters were closed and repurposed as mosques. Celebration of the Western and Iranian New Year was forbidden. Taking photographs and displaying pictures or portraits was forbidden, as it was considered by the Taliban as a form of idolatry.

And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book  everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- the Bible isn't a book; it's a library. It's a collection of books.

AskHistorians,"I am a historian of Classical Greek warfare. Ask Me Anything about the Peloponnesian War, the setting of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey","Hi r/AskHistorians! I'm u/Iphikrates, known offline as Dr Roel Konijnendijk, and I'm a historian with a specific focus on wars and warfare in the Classical period of Greek history (c. 479-322 BC). 

The central military and political event of this era is the protracted Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) between Athens and Sparta. This war has not often been the setting of major products of pop culture, but now there's a new installment in the *Assassin's Creed* series by Ubisoft, which claims to tell its secret history. I'm sure many of you have been playing the game and now have questions about the actual conflict - how it was fought, why it mattered, how much of the game is based in history, who its characters really were, and so on. Ask Me Anything!

I wanted to give you an update and some more help with the next step of determining if there were slaves on this property. I got a lot of great contacts that you guys provided in the comments.

I was subsequently contacted by a reddit user that works for the GA department of Archaeology that works directly for the GA State Archaeologist, Rachel Black. As I was writing this comment Ms. Black called me so we had a great discussion and she has connected me to a resource at UGA that she believes can help me further.

I imagine this change is due in part because the revolution happened, and we had relative peace since then, but still, Russia has been at peace for a while and it is still very militaristic, so there must be more to it

Edit:

I just want to mention that while my grandparents and other old relatives have told me many stories of when they were little that make it seem like everyone had guns at no point I got the impression that they missed guns, nor were they resentful that they didn't own guns anymore.

AskHistorians,Big boys don't cry: when became strong emotions in men unmanly?,"So I was reading The Song of Roland (ca. 1040-1115), and when Roland sees his men lying dead on the battlefield, he falls into a swoon.

This reminded me of the Alliterative Morte Arthure, especially the moment Arthur sees that Gawain has been slain. He cries, kisses his dead friend, swoons, cries some more, is told to get a grip on himself and swoons again. 

A much later example would be the Romance poets and authors, who are also very sensitive to strong emotions. Like the romance knights, they have to stay in control of their sorrow or happiness, but being easily overwhelmed is not seen as a bad thing.

Today, there are voices that call for (much needed) acceptance of men's emotionality, but it is still kind of taboo. I was wondering when and why this changed in western society.

Both countries were victim to failed economic policies instituted by their occupiers, whether it be Britain's strict adherence to *laissez faire* capitalism or Stalin's rush to modernisation. 

The Irish potato famine, though an atrocity, is generally not referred to as a genocide due to a lack of proof of genocidal intent and is rather categorised as an act of historical neglect and incompetence. The general trend is that although the British both contributed to the circumstances that led to the famine, and did a terrible job responding to it, the famine wasn't a deliberate act of mass-murder with the extinction of Catholic Irish as its goal. A tragedy of apathy and economics rather than one of hatred.

Could there have been other, more lewd and anatomically correct statues that weren’t as valuable or well preserved in important places or were later destroyed by zealots or looters and are just lost to histor",4363,0.96,48,0.0004,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qezg92/are_there_any_notable_nude_statues_from_greek_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qezg92/are_there_any_notable_nude_statues_from_greek_and/
AskHistorians,"With fascism being almost universally condemned after the fall of Hitler and Mussolini, how did Francisco Franco's regime continue to persist until well into the mid-70s?","Why didn't the allies intervene in Spain after the Nazis were defeated? 

How was Francoist Spain, which only came to be because of Germany and Italy in the first place, able to sustain itself, presumably have trade and diplomatic relations with other counties in Europe, after the world had, almost unilaterally, decided how dangerous fascism was?

And was Franco ""tolerated"" by the West in order to prevent the spread of communism on the Iberian peninsula?

Did he try to distance himself from other fascist regimes in order to appear more ""moderate""? I hear he is often considered a ""semi-fascist"", did that play into it as well?

Apparently the Mongols weren't able to take a single one in several invasions of Hungary and Poland. Hungary was also said to have constructed over 60 stone castles in the years following the first invasion, and they seemed to have worked flawlessly against the 2nd invasion. Historian Andrej Janes even notes that ""well-fortiﬁed castles were impenetrable to the Mongol army"". 

So why is this? Historian Stephen Pow points to natural terrain advantages, but that doesn't seem like it's the whole answer.

AskHistorians,"Why is Julius Caesar the most iconic Roman in history despite the fact that he was neither Rome's most prolific conqueror, nor its most powerful ruler?","Caesar is clearly the most well-known Roman. If you ask any average person in a Western country  if they can name a Roman, they would likely name Caesar, and it's also striking that so many leaders from history referred to themselves as Caesars — the Prussian and Austrian Kaisers, Russian Tzars, I just read a bio of Charles V and he referred to himself as ""Caesar."" Even the Roman emperors would call themselves Caesars. But why is Caesar such a respected name?

I remember reading from one of Adrian Goldsworthy's books that the prestige of a Roman conquest was based more on the sophistication and power of the conquered people than on the sheer amount of land that Rome acquired. Because of this, I would suspect that Scipio Africanus's victory over Carthage, Aemilius Paullus's victory over Macedon, and Pompey's victories in the Near East gave Rome more pride than Caesar's victory over the Gauls, who were a somewhat ""barbaric"" people compared to Rome's mediterranean adversaries.

AskHistorians,Monday Methods: On why 'Did Ancient Warriors Get PTSD?' isn't such a simple question.,"It's one of the most commonly asked questions on AskHistorians: did soldiers in the ancient world get PTSD?

It's a simple question, one that could potentially have a one word answer ('yes' or 'no'). It's one with at least some empathy - we understand that the ancients lived in a harsh, brutal world, and people these days who live through harsh, brutal events often get diagnosed by psychiatrists or psychologists with post-traumatic stress disorder (usually called by the acronym PTSD). It's a reasonable question to ask. As would be the far less common question about whether ancient women got PTSD after experiencing the horrors of war that women experience.

It's also not a simple question at all, in any way, shape, or form, and clinicians and historians differ fundamentally on how to answer the question. This is because the question can't be resolved without first resolving some fairly fundamental questions about human nature, and why we are the way we are, that inevitably end up tippin",3910,0.95,195,0.0025,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9mdx60/monday_methods_on_why_did_ancient_warriors_get/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9mdx60/monday_methods_on_why_did_ancient_warriors_get/

The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.

These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.

If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing.","I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.

Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.

A bright title card for Suits comes up.

Who has ever finished a film and on finishing it clicks the recommended film straight away?  And yet the ads come up, every single time. It completely ruins the moment. And yes, you can click the box to continue watching the credits- but why should we even have to do that? Why is it so hard for Netflix to not promote their material for five minutes after a film ends?

In a life bombarded by advertisements do we have to be shown another one the second a film finishes? Is there no respite?

movies,"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?","I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable.

movies,Disney pricing their new releases at $30 on top of regular Disney+ subscription sets a bad precedence for future of streaming,"With release of Mulan at $30 on Disney+ even if you had a subscription doesn't really bode well for us consumers in future where we have to shell out extra money even after paying for 3-4 subscriptions already on average (Netflix, Disney+, Prime, HBO). Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

movies,"Watch John Wick 1 & 2. Then watch Constantine. Constantine feels like a sequel in a series where our protagonist, John, develops the ability to fight Hell itself. The continuity is made possible because everyone refers to the character as “John” and treats him with a reserved respect.","This a very cool continuity exercise, one that I accidentally stumbled upon in a search to watch movies with detached heroes doing the “right” thing out of obligation. Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as “John” goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it’s Keanu’s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity.

A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go.

All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story.

movies,Disney lost the Best Animated Film for the first time since 2006,"After Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse won Best Animated Film last night, it got me thinking about how it seemed like finally an animated film not made by Disney or Pixar won that category. So I went and looked it up and sure enough, Disney/Pixar has won the Oscar in this category every single year they had a movie up for nomination, since 2006 (in 2011, they didn’t have a movie up for nomination AND YES, as everyone keeps asking in the comment section: Rango won this year. Disney did not have a movie nominated, and Rango won, and no, Rango is not a Disney movie). In 2006, they lost the Oscar to Happy Feet (the Disney movie up for nomination was Cars).

As much of a Disney movie lover as I am, I’m so glad that the Academy didn’t just blindly hand over the award to Disney again, but actually chose the best of the bunch. And I’m so glad it’s Into The Spider-Verse. This movie deserves it.

movies,The transformation of Rambo from broken veteran to unstoppable killing machine is a real cultural loss.,"There really isn’t a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.

I can't think of any other film like it. First it's an excellent and loving parody to Star Trek. Second, it's actually a great science fiction adventure film with a good plot. The comedy is great, but the dramatic moments are just as impact. The part where Tim Allen has to explain to Balthzar that they are actors is heartbreaking. Everyone involved with the film seemed to totally understand and buy into what they were making. I can't think of another film that blends the line between parody and drama so flawlessly.

15 years ago today, Cartoon Network gave three hours in the middle of the night to an experiment called Adult Swim.
 
For the last 10 years in a row, the network has ranked No. 1 among adults 18-34 years old in basic-cable ratings across the total day. The median age of the Adult Swim viewer is 24 years old, about half that of viewers across all broadcast and cable channels.
 
It saved Family Guy and is responsible for making Seth MacFarlane a TV powerhouse with three shows, three movies, a nine figure net worth, and a relationship with Emilia Clarke. (not a good thing to everyone)
 
It saved Futurama.
 
It turned Tim and Eric from two weirdos who were mailing unsolicited DVD’s to Bob Odenkirk to comedy superstars with a multimedia and multichannel entertainment kingdom with two movies and thirteen television shows, including Nathan for You, Comedy Bang!

According to SyFy and Cas, they are willing to ""discuss"" The Expanse again if our Nielsen ratings go up for the rest of this season. Most simply, this means more people watching live, DVR'ing, and watching within 3 days of the broadcast.

Bob Ross was not just a TV painter. Beyond extending the joy of painting to millions who might otherwise have never thought themselves capable, Bob taught us to believe in ourselves, in the amazing power hidden in each and every soul. He understood the value of different perspectives, and encouraged all of his viewers to embrace their own unique humanity. He recognized the importance of both tragedy and beauty in the context of life as well as nature. 

Beyond all this, Bob Ross was one of the kindest, gentlest spirits to ever grace our TV screens. For as long as he could, he worked to make this world a prettier place, one painting at a time. For that, I will always look up to him.

Happy painting, Bob, and God bless.

Thank you for showing us as we really are. Not what some people say in political rallies, not what the narrative of some part of the U.S political discourse tells a part of the American electorate. Our relationship historically was based on suspicision, distrust, and hate at times, but like Dylan said, ""The times are a changin'"", so many Mexicans like myself, that is a child of the internet, that grew up with Mr. Rogers and Thundercats are embracing the notion of how similar we are. 

We might not see eye to eye on many issues but we do care about you, we cared when Katrina hit and a battalion of Mexicans troops rushed to help and tons of supplies were raised in a nationwide effort. You cared when the deadliest earthquake hit Mexico City and you rushed to our help not to mention our interminable economic issues all the way until 1994.

I dont think there is a show that has been made that is anywhere close to resembling this unique, subtle show. I love South Park, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons, Futurama, Bob's Burgers, Archer, ect but King of the Hill is as great of a animated show that I have ever seen. It's hardly ever on tv anymore (currently watching on comedy central at 6 AM Colorado time) but it is one of those shows I want to dive deep into. I just watched the episode where Dale thinks he has rabies and is a wild man in the woods. All time classic in my mind. Thanks for listening to my rant 🙏 ps That's my purse, I dont know you!

**What the hell is a witcher?**

The world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.

In order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile.

“Once we give a number for a show, then every show will be benchmarked off of that show even though they were built sometimes for very specific audiences,” he said.


He added: “There is a very natural inclination to say, ‘Relative to this show, this show is a failure.’ That puts a lot of creative pressure on the talent.”

If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.

Was super pumped to see one of my favorite bands play a classic album from 20 years ago and was willing to travel about 2 hours to go see it (and probably still will) but damn you know how to take advantage of people when there is no other option in place other than physically getting to the venue.

Comment if you think I'm missing any songs, or any song doesn't deserve to be in there!

He’ll put out some half-assed apology while he’s stoned and this will be forgotten and happen again in less than a year.  This part of human psychology that makes people idolize these human turds baffles the fuck out of me.

My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well.

music,Modern country music is a shell of what it's supposed to be and I understand why so many people hate it.,"I know a lot of people hate the country music genre in general, but modern country is an absolute shell of what country music started as and is supposed to be. You used to be able to have a country song without it including mud, a truck, beer, the mention of cowboy boots or a cornfield. It's supposed to be much more than that and I think if we still had country from the good 'ol days, a lot less people would hate it. Country music is supposed to draw from down to earth living, love of the simple things, living a rural or blue collar life, overcoming struggle, working hard, love, etc just like a lot of other genres. Nowadays you're hard pressed to find a country song that's not part an extremely specific stereotype that's been pumped out for the past decade.

I understand some people are just never going to enjoy or relate to country music and that's fine but Jesus Christ let's stop acting like 85% of these modern artists are country.

Outside of 3 albums, my only experience with rock music is from video game soundtracks, movies and TV commercials. I tried to go into each one with an open mind and as blind as possible, doing research afterwards. This took 5 months to complete. Also, I chose to listen to them in a random order, as to not develop a unconscious bias for the older stuff.

1. Bob Dylan - The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963): B+ [2 listens] not really rock, but still very entertaining. He's really more of a poet than a musician and the lyrics carry the whole thing, with the music not being too impressive. I set a full day aside for his discography, so I would fully appreciate his later stuff if I understood what he first sounded like

Hey Reddit,

Since my last AMA I’ve had a burning hole in my soul that only you can fill, so I’m back!.

I've had a a great time recently touring with Take That around the UK and you can see a video of some of the antics here in my version of Giant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf5jK46Cwe8

I’ve also gone a bit bonkers recently and made a spoof of Calvin Harris’s Fly Eye Glasses video.  'WTF' I hear you say?  Well in that case have a watch and read the description too for some much needed context.  https://youtu.be/LBHfRE3aE7c

So with all that said, strap yourself in and grab a cup of tea!   

P.S. I still love you /u/thebad_comedian

music,"Ticketmaster is fucking terrible - it is saying concert tickets are $94, but when I got to check out, they are charging me $200 per ticket!","Some friends thought it would be fun to see Sting play and tickets are pricey ($94), but it's kind of a bucket list act that I've always wanted to see.  They get added to the cart as $94 + fees per ticket on the ticket selection page, which you would think would come out to be $400 or so at the end for 4 tickets.

Except when you get to the check out screen next, the tickets are now ""Advance Admission"" tickets and are $194.00 per ticket, + $15.50 service fee, + 4.75 order fee, + shipping because you cannot actually print them at home.  The total is now $842.75 for 4 tickets that when you go to buy them says $94 per ticket + fees.

So the ""Advance Admission"" must be adding a charge but there is no way to remove it and when you call, you get told the volume of calls is too high for you to talk to an operator so it disconnects.  Each ""Advance Admission"" GA ticket is $194!

So 4 tickets x $94 = $376

That means that the fees are $466.75!  This is outrageous.

music,The K-Pop industry is disturbing and has a dark side that is hard to ignore.,"The music industry as a whole is dark and ugly, but I have a particular hatred for the K-Pop industry. It’s a well-oiled machine. Young teens are groomed to perfection by these large entertainment companies with the sole purpose of making as much money as they can from their “investments”. 

Kids sign their lives away to these entertainment companies and are under strict control and supervision throughout their entire careers. They leave their families as young teens for training, with no guarantee to be a part of any group for years. And through all this, they are subjected to mental and physical abuse, which has pushed some k-pop artists to commit suicide. The pressures of the industry and the fans in South Korea are enormous, and Asia in general is on an entirely different level. 

These k-pop stars also have no say in any creative aspect of their music or performances. Every little detail and idea comes from the entertainment company. This aspect of the industry is troubling becaus",31692,0.83,2526,0.0135,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/m4ura1/the_kpop_industry_is_disturbing_and_has_a_dark/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/m4ura1/the_kpop_industry_is_disturbing_and_has_a_dark/

There’s actually a lot more going on there than I knew back in the late ‘90s when it was all over the radio. Key to my newfound appreciation of it is reading the lyrics, most of which I couldn’t actually make out just from listening. Here they are, in their entirety:

Another Brick in the Wall, Pt 2. is just brilliant, with awesome guitar and bass rhythms. The guitar solo in Young Lust is so radical!! This band was so ahead of their time and I can’t believe I didn’t listen to this album earlier. I can’t wait to hear more of their music.

We got hacked last week - someone stole Thom’s minidisk archive from around the time of OK Computer, and reportedly demanded $150,000 on threat of releasing it.

So instead of complaining - much - or ignoring it, we’re releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of Extinction Rebellion: https://radiohead.bandcamp.com

Just for the next 18 days. So for £18 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom.

Never intended for public consumption (though some clips did reach the cassette in the OK Computer reissue) it’s only tangentially interesting. And very, very long. Not a phone download. Rainy out, isn’t it though?

Donald Trump kicked off his third bid for the White House on Tuesday night (Nov. 15) at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and within an hour the twice-impeached one-term former president was already facing his latest threat of legal sanction.

In the midst of a nest of investigations into Trump’s actions before and during his tumultuous four-year term, the estate of late R&B/soul legend Isaac Hayes tweeted that it was exploring its legal options to stop the former reality star from using one of Hayes’ compositions at his campaign events. “Once again, the estate and family of Isaac Hayes DID NOT approve the use of ‘Hold On I’m Coming’ by Sam and Dave by Donald Trump at his 2024 Presidential announcement tonight,” read the tweet from the reps for the singer/composer who died in 2008 at age 65.

music,Is the Grammies anything other than a celebrity wankfest? [Serious],"Looking at the awards list, I don't really get it. With a few exceptions, it seems like everyone gets the same awards every year as a way to pat themselves on the back for singing music that is usually not even written by them. I'm sorry but I just don't get it. And Megadeth gets the best metal album of the year award, obviously because they're a metal band and released an album this year. Is there any thought that goes into picking the winners of each category? Gojira, Obscura, Vektor, all released fantastic albums this year. 



Maybe I'm wrong but it seriously feels like the grammys are a joke. Could they not do a better job of recognizing artists talents, rather than their commercial success?

However, due to complaints of parents and administration at Aliso Niguel High School, that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis promote misogyny and Drug Use, had to decline the concert and grant money. I find this atrocious. I might not be a fan of MRL, however I find it silly that concerned parents are portraying Mack as a misogynistic drug enabler. As a member of the high school Orchestra, the $10,000 was the most important part of the contest, as expenses pile up fast especially when split between choir and band. 

Many of our student body is upset at the administration's decision and unwillingness to reach a compromise.

When I was 22, one of my friends in the music industry recommended wearing earplugs -- she recommended EarPeace (\~$25), which are reusable earplugs that musicians wear and they're always attached to my keys. Alternatively, you can get the disposable ones that are 24/$4.99 at a local drug store. My hearing is fine because of this sage advice from my friend.

People will think the contrary but it improves the listening experience.

You can't love your favorite artists if you can't hear them. Stan your ears.

Edit: Even if you already suffer from tinnitus/hearing loss, earplugs can help! Chris Martin said that wearing earplugs has helped with his tinnitus.

This sucks because my favorite genre is Hip Hop.  I was a big Public Enemy/BDP fan and grew up in white washed Midwest suburbs before moving to the Philly area.

Andrew Woolfolk, a longtime saxophone player for Earth, Wind & Fire, has died. In an Instagram post, Woolfolk’s Earth, Wind & Fire band mate Philip Bailey wrote that Woolfolk had been dealing with a serious illness for several years. He was 71. Pitchfork has contacted representatives for Earth, Wind & Fire for comment.

Woolfolk joined the band in 1972, sticking with the outfit through 1985. He re-joined the band when they returned from a hiatus in 1987 and kept his role until 1993. Bailey, who had known Woolfolk since their high school days, had recruited him to the group after the departure of Ronnie Laws. Woolfolk’s period with Earth, Wind & Fire covered much of their most celebrated material, including “September,” “Shining Star,” and “Boogie Wonderland.” He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the band in 2000.

It’s often hard to quantify the excesses of the rich and powerful. Sure, we can clock the total cost of a red carpet outfit, do some napkin math to figure out how much a big gala must have cost, or watch the super-mansion price listings like very jealous hawks. But for most of the things that separate the Famouses from us Normals, it’s very hard to get any kind of itemized listing of all the ways they’re just plain better than us mere mortals.

The exception to that rule, typically, is private jet use, on account of flight records being public knowledge that has to be logged with various airports—hence a whole little cottage industry of blogs and accounts that keep an eye on the flight times of the hoi polloi.

The first concert I ever went to was Eric Clapton's Crossroads Tour, which was back in 1988.  I think I paid something like $20 for the ticket, and got decent seats, which, adjusted for inflation, is about $41 now.  Tickets were the same price throughout the whole stadium.  It all depended on how soon you got tickets.  So, some fan dedication was required to get good seats.

Yesterday, I got an email offering me pre-sales of Paul Simon tickets.  Being in my late 40s, and never having seen Paul Simon before, I figured it would be worth checking him out.

I click on the link and my choices are $47.50 for nose bleed crappy seats all the way through $175.00 for the VIP package, which includes seats up close.

I find those prices to be completely insane!

I used to be a big believer in supporting artists by going to see them live, and I always dreamed of being able to take my kids to concerts with me so we could ",16026,0.9,3132,0.0195,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/7weazr/concerts_have_gotten_way_too_damn_expensive/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/7weazr/concerts_have_gotten_way_too_damn_expensive/

> Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.

Instead just hit play. I painstakingly try to find a flow between songs that fit together and transition into another song.

I hope everyone enjoys it. I have really bad anxiety and depression, so this playlist means quite a lot to me and I hope it reaches the ears of others and gives them peace of mind too. (Added bonus, I suggest using rainymood to enhance the listening experience.)

books,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes.

books,I feel like an idiot. I vastly misunderstood how a library card works for years.,"So, I was talking to my wife and the subject came to library cards and how she had one. I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

books,"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone","It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other.

Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year.

books,I finally had the realization that it's ok to stop reading a book that you aren't enjoying.,"I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe.

I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. 

I always told myself “I’m just too stressed with school”, “oh I’m just in a reading slump I’ll come out of it soon”, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. 

It wasn’t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. 

She said “oh you’re turning into me”. 

I wasn’t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn’t a slump.

There's this book I want its a Swedish horror novel and every single copy I can find the cover is a still from the movie adaption. I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don't want a film poster on it. I almost don't even want to get the book.

I don't want to see the movie cover I want to see the original book cover. I love how unique book cover art can be and I feel like slapping the movie poster on every new copy does the book a slight disservice.

Dyslexia prevented me from fully absorbing the material. Now I’m whisked away to whichever world I choose. I never thought I’d ever be able to enjoy reading as I do now. I’m incredibly grateful.

Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors.

Or, would have given 5 stars, if you rated books?

1) generate perhaps more diverse answers than ""your favourite book"" question and 

2) give lots of recommendations all-around

**EDIT, This book is not available in English yet. Silly me**
My last 5 star book that I can't stop raving about is **The Rabbit Yard** by Johannes Anyuru. It's very topical as it starts with an act of terrorism. The book is part dystopian, but even if you're not into dystopia, it's also so much more. The story is clever and the book is also moving in parts. The ending is totally unforgettable.

1984 is great at illustrating the warning behind government totalitarianism. The characters live in a world where the government monitors everything you do.

Brave New World is a similar warning from the stand point of a Technocratic Utopian control

F451 is explores a world about how ignorance is rampant and causes the decline of education to the point where the government begins to regulate reading.

I couldn't find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a ""Dutch Tolkien"". She told me bluntly that I shouldn't read fantasy and that she doesn't consider it to be ""real literature"". She basically thinks that Tolkien's books aren't ""real literature"".

And I'm too excited; like, I want to suggest this book TO EVERYONE! Damn! 

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS— Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

If anybody is keenly interested in biological sciences, this is a book for them. It'll make you 'scared-to-death' (spoiler?).

books,I hate when it’s obvious authors didn’t do basic research and it really kills the mood.,"I was reading “The Perfect Marriage” by Adam Mitzner and there was a moment that made me say that’s not even close to correct. A lawyer was speaking to a character explaining a charge and said:

And it completely took me out of the situation because I immediately went no that’s not how that works. 2nd is typically NOT premeditated which is its main distinguishing factor from 1st. The involvement of a police officer does not have any bearing on it at all. Unless I’m severely mistaken, but I don’t think I am.

books,I read The Hobbit to my 6 year old son over the course of two months. It was one of the best experiences of my life.,"I've been waiting to read The Hobbit to my son since he was born but I had to wait until he was old enough to appreciate it. It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim.

books,"Ender's Game seems like the poster child for 'support the art not the artist'. I don't understand how an outspoken homophobe wrote this amazing book that champions the power of empathy, but thank goodness for libraries and used book stores so we can still read and enjoy this wonderful book.","Orson Scott Card is an outspoken homophobe who donates to anti-gay causes, so its a pretty natural response to not want to support him financially. Here are a couple quotes from him on the issue:

>""Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down.""  
>  
>""The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.""

So, gross is a bit of an understatement. That said, Ender's Game has an incredibly important message that it would truly be a shame to lose. Thank goodness we're fans of a medium which has options for consuming the art without financially supporting the artist.

books,Modern libraries are awesome and deserve a shoutout!,"Last year, I moved to a new city and my first instinct was to pick up a library card from my nearest public library. It's amazing how they have changed with the times! 

My library has three media rooms, a 3D printer (plus classes to take on how to use it), a video production library full of equipment you can check out, a teen game room, yoga classes, small business classes and more. I was really amazed at how much of a central community hub it had become compared to my old public library which was still a bit older and dated. 

You can even check out a kindle while you go on vacation! You can preload books to read and take it with you. Simply return once you get home. Now I live on the road and constantly travel. I use their online catalog to rent ebooks onto my kindle. I literally have a library with me wherever I go!

Four full length books are already out with JK Rowling's permission, all completely free!","The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

books,Has Stephen King always put weirdly sexual things into his books or did I just stumble onto two that happened to have it?,"*SPOILER* I read Billy Summers a couple months ago and really liked the parental, father/daughter vibe I THOUGHT I was getting from the relationship of the two main characters, until the young woman (19/20) ends up falling in love with the 45 year old (!!!) man. 

And now I am halfway through Firestarter which I believe is a new release and once again there is a grown man, developing a weird romantic relationship with an 8 year old! 

Such a shame because I really enjoyed both books up until he introduced this point. In both books it literally adds nothing to the plot, the storyline would have been literally unchanged if he kept it non-romantic/sexual. I was planning on reading more of his books but after these two I am probably going to give up.

Of these, about 12 were from my personal purchases (physical books and audiobooks), while about 40 came from the library.  So let that sink in, a normal book costs $10 to $15, but I'll assume each book costs $20 because I also borrow textbooks, which are more expensive than ordinary books. So, 40 books at $20 each equals $800. This means I save about $800 a year because of the library. But if I calculate the total number of books I borrowed from the library, both finished and unfinished, I checked my loan history and found that I borrowed about 120 books. That would cost $2,400. So, the library helps me save a lot of money. Now, Youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, ps5, ps4 ,Nintendo Switch consume much of my time. However, if I want to learn in-depth topics or great stories, books are still number one in my heart, and the library is one of the greatest inventions.

The sun goes down upon the Ankh,  
And slowly, softly fades -  
Across the Drum; the Royal Bank;  
The River-Gate; the Shades.

A stony circle's closed to elves;  
And here, where lines are blurred,  
Between the stacks of books on shelves,  
A quiet '*Ook*' is heard.

A copper steps the city-street  
On paths he's often passed;  
The final march; the final beat;  
The time to rest at last.

He gives his badge a final shine,  
And sadly shakes his head -  
While Granny lies beneath a sign  
That says: 'I aten't dead.'

The Luggage shifts in sleep and dreams;  
It's now. The time's at hand.  
For where it's always night, it seems,  
A timer clears of sand.

And so it is that Death arrives,  
When all the time has gone...

In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19.

For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.

Like many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words.

books,Life's too short to read books you're not enjoying,"Last night, I started a new book. I'm guessing I bought it at the library book sale based on the cover and the blurb on the back. I hadn't read anything from this author. From the moment I started the book, it was awful, like a high schooler's first attempt at a novel.

I kept reading until I reached this paragraph: ""Maybe he hadn't gone too far. Maybe he wasn't in deep doodoo. Who knows, he might even get to screw her"" on page 8. I closed the book and can't wait to re-donate it back to the library - at least they'll make another dollar if it sells again.

Anyway, the point is I always see posts about people who want to know how far in a book they should read before giving up. My advice: when you're not enjoying it. That's when you stop. Life is just too damn short to read a book that you're not enjoying (unless, of course, it's for a school assignment).

It's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.

But by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.

There are actually two reasons why I quit this book:

1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)

2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.

So for those with the ability to visualize, does it just happen as you quickly as you read? Or does it happen more after the fact as you recall characters and events?

It’s not that I don’t dislike the ideology, per say. I mean, I don’t prescribe to Ayn Rand’s world views, but that’s not the reason I don’t like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It’s just that she’s so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that’s the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.

If you want me to believe what you’re writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with “Fahrenheit 451”. The world feels natural, as does the message.

A kid picks a book, and the parents find a reason to give it a fault. Either it has too many pictures, or no pictures at all, or it's ""not your thing"", or it's too long or too short. It's even worse when they say it mockingly.

From time to time I try to intervene and say something in the lines of ""hey, I happened to have read this book with my little sister, and I found it really good"" to try to convince the parents to let the kid read the book, but I don't do that too often because no one likes strangers bringing in their unsolicited opinions. 

I started reading when I was 11, and it was the diary of a wimpy kid. I was going grocery shopping with my family and instead of going to the toys aisle with my sisters as usual I decided to take a look at the books (even though I had no interest in books at all).

I read the blurb, blah blah BAU Agent racing to find serial killer before he releases a virus. Ambitious jump, but sounds fun.

books,Has anyone ever noticed how certain male authors talk excessively about their female character's breasts?,"I just started reading *Altered Carbon* by Richard Morgan, and I noticed how the introduction and description of one of the characters seemed to revolve around her breasts.

>She stood facing me, flushed, breasts rising and falling distractingly.

-

> Mrs. Bancroft’s breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

books,Which Books Do You Consider A Perfect 10/10?,"Which books would you consider a perfect 10/10 in your eyes? It doesn't matter if it's a popular classic or if it's an underrated gem that feels like only you've read it, please just share with me the books you consider perfect and maybe a little reason why you think so. Feel free to post one book or multiple books.

For me, the books I consider perfect are Les Miserables, Don Quixote, Watership Down and The Iliad (there's bound to be more but for the time being these are the ones that pop into my head).

Les Miserables - it's tragic but also immensely life-affirming. You can't help but love Jean Valjean: for every wrong he does, he attempts to right it and throughout his life he sticks by that ethic even when it's the most difficult thing to do. There's so many characters that intertwine and interact with each other that it's hard not to fall for some of the relationships in this book too, especially Marius and Eponine.

books,Why You Should Not Read More,"Reading more is a good goal, always. However, the way that I've seen ""reading more"" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on ""how to read more"" is almost always terrible, such as speed ""reading"", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.

It's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.

You'd never find a cinephile saying ""Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible.""

I came across a book trending in the Thriller section - _The Moonlight Child_ by Karen McQuestion. It’s got a 4.22 rating and that’s quite high, in my estimation, especially for something that probably isn’t literary fiction or destined to be a classic. (But who knows? I haven’t read it, and I could be wildly mistaken.)

I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow.

The quote above comes from Viktor Frankl as he explains life at a Nazi concentration camp. He suffered from edema, which caused his tissues to swell up and made moving around torture. His feet were uncovered as he walked through snow and didn’t have a pair of socks–not that he could wear them anyway because his shoes were already tight due to his swollen feet.

books,What's your favorite opening line to a book?,"Mine is probably the opening line to Salem's Lot: “Almost everyone thought the man and the boy were father and son.”

This line tells us so much. It tells us the relative ages of the two main characters, that they are not related, and that they are currently in a place where people don't know them (otherwise, why would everyone be wrong about their relationship?). This information then leads the reader to wonder why these two guys are away from their homes. What could have driven them out? Where is the family of the boy? Why would he travel without them?

So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here's what I noticed:

1. I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn't prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.
2. I went to a presentation about criminal justi",13020,0.93,553,0.003,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ahfcxf/when_i_replaced_social_media_with_reading/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ahfcxf/when_i_replaced_social_media_with_reading/
books,The Dresden Files is unreadable because of how women are described,"I got through 3 of the Dresden Files books before I had to put them down. The author just cannot keep from commenting on how sexy every single female character is and how chivalrous and misogynistic Harry is. 
An example from the book:
 ""She pushed back her asphalt-colored hair with one hand and gave me a look of pure calculation. Then she simply crossed her legs, so that the cut of her dress left one pale leg bare to midthigh. A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric. “Of course, Mr. Dresden. I’m sure we can do business.” The look she gave me was direct, sensual, and willing."" 

Every single woman is portrayed exactly like this and I think it represents the worst in Urban Fantasy.

Cell data comes and goes here so I'll be checking the thread here and there answering whenever I can. It's really nice to talk about this stuff though because I'm pretty much the only serious reader up here lol

A little background first: In early 2021 my life kind of fell apart very quickly. I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown.

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I can’t help but add the very first book that started the frenzy off. The story of a young girl who defected from North Korea was so riveting, I finished it in three days. She had a TED talk as well for those who are interested. 


**The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak

The WW2 era always fascinated me, and the story of a young girl in Nazi Germany shows a side to the war us Americans rarely see. Tragedy, love, and a passion for reading kept me entangled for too many late nights on this one.


**The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

I really should include all three of her “Wayfarer” series in this, as well as her latest fourth book. This was a Reddit Book Club section that I enjoyed SO much, I immediately bought the remaining two: “A Closed and Common Orbit” and “Record of a Spaceborn Few”. Chambers has a way of writing such believable science fiction without sounding dull or over the top. I wish she had more novels out.

books,I’ve finished The Name of the Wind and I am blown away,"The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the single best book I’ve read in a long, long time. If there was ever a book that held me so captivated for so long before, I certainly don’t remember. Rothfuss certainly has a way with words especially when establishing atmosphere and ambiance. His world is rife with character and depth and is as lively as our own, as well as adorably tongue-in-cheek at times. Each character I feel like I know on a personal level. I had legitimate difficulty putting this book down and that has not happened in at least ten years. 

One of my favorite things about this series is that there’s a sort of science to the magic the characters create, which called sympathy. This lets you more or less deduce how things take effect and sort of tally what’s happening magically, something I don’t think a lot of fantasy books have, in my experience. Rothfuss meshes magic with actual established science and reason making it just that much more believable.

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story.

I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

The writing seemed very similar to Twilight as I was reading it, and I checked the back for the author and it says ""Rebecca Morrow is a pseudonym for a New York Times Best Selling author"".

But even then there’s big stuff I don’t remember like what was in the chamber of secrets, who the prisoner of Azcaban was, what the other horecruxes were, and what the triangle circle line logo thing was. I do remember quite a bit of Goblet of Fire though for some reason.

books,I think refusing to name your ghostwriters is immoral,"I'm thinking of three authors right now:

* Danielle Steele, 179 books in about 49 years, who [claims she regularly writes 22 hours a day](https://www.glamour.com/story/danielle-steel-books-interview). I'm gonna go out on a limb and call bullshit.
* R.L. Stine, over 300 books in 30 years
* R.A. Salvatore, 103 books in 34 years
* *numbers are probably slightly off*

I think these authors should list their ghostwriter's as co-authors for the following reasons:

* They didn't write the book alone. If a ghostwriter substantially contributed to a book, they deserve to be recognized for doing so.
* The author's sole claim to having written the book is false, a lie.
* As a reader, If I like a book, I want to read the other books the ghostwriter wrote.
* The quiet use of ghostwriters creates an unrealistic expectation in new writer's minds that successful writers can crank out 4 or more books a year. I mean, it's possible, but you will wear yourself out.

That's my opinion. What's yours?

books,So my date took me to a bookstore yesterday...,"I hope this isn't off topic for this subreddit but I wanted to share a book related adventure I went on yesterday afternoon. This guy I really like asked me out for coffee and then took me to Barnes & Noble. Before we went in he gave me instructions:

""You need to pick out the best book you've never read.""

So we went in and after some very careful deliberation I picked out *When the Killing's Done* by T. C. Boyle and he ended up with *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor. Once we revealed our selections he looked me in the eye and said ""Now switch!""

So now I have to read about China's Communist leaders and he has to read T. C. Boyle. I wanted to share this because I thought it was a clever idea for a first date between book lovers and an unusual way of getting to know someone based on their taste in books. 

Has anyone else done something like this? If so, how did it turn out?

If you are Dan Brown, you are probably taking notes so you can imitate that fabulous sentence structure. It was very descriptive. You probably like the way Dean Koontz fit the word ""expensive"" in there, just in case his readers thought Cessna airplanes were cheap.

books,Authors who describe EVERY single female that appears in thier book as if they are a potential lay is a way to instantly lose my respect.,"It's just lazy.

I dont care how down to earth or likeable a main character is. When the perspective comes across like every  woman they encounter is either lusting after them, or being sized-up and put into different categories of dream-girl archetypes, it turns the otherwise relatable main character into a leering creep. 

Can you imagine reading a book where every male character was introduced as simple archetypes like ""bad boy type"", or by the size of thier package, despite thier role in the story?


Edit:
If it matters, I also like women and get the appeal of reading about boobies, but I dont need to know about every booby if said booby isnt important to the story.

I had teachers and parents heavily prejudiced against me and my mom. It also didn't help that my mother had mental, economic issues, which made her a terrible mother.

Our English teacher was in her mid twenties, and she was stern, everyone used to be scared of her. That summer we all got different books to write assignment on.

* Very enjoyable - good, concise world-building.  And an excellent job making a protagonist who is a bad guy... but you still want him to win.  Romantic plotline is unnecessary and feels very groomingy.  Sharp writing.

Why? Because I've seen this SO MANY times. Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.

We’ve all heard that liking this novel is a “red flag” and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel.

As someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He’s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it’s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: “that kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.”

I feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn’t this very obvio",11206,0.85,1591,0.0213,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/peiw7o/do_people_who_proudly_hate_on_catcher_in_the_rye/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/peiw7o/do_people_who_proudly_hate_on_catcher_in_the_rye/
books,Shrek was a book?!,"I was doing some reading about the history of [Shrek](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg) (long story), and learned that it was a children’s book written ten years before the movie came out.

Not only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as 1. A super prolific children's author ([Dr. De Soto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif), Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the [New Yorker](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg) (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).

In short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.

Curious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:

books,"If you hate working, Post Office by Charles Bukowski is a must","A semi autobiographical account, we follow Henry, a man in his mid 30s who needs a job and joins the Postal Office only to absolutely hate it. Yet despite this, he is only one of a handful of 200 employees that last 11 years. We follow his  monotonous routine of filing letters, being micro managed and taking the mail to unhappy and crazy neighbors. His personal life is also a mess with random hook ups, breaks ups and deaths.

What makes this book so good isn't the prose; it's blatant and straight forward. It's not the plot as their isn't really one. It's just how raw it is. Henry is both sympathetic and pathetic. I relate so much to him when he complains about bureaucracy and having to fake being interested in your job to your employer. He also seems hopeless for not planning a way out. But that's sort of the thing about this book, there are people who put up with the grind and die. It's horrifying and funny and brutally hoenst.

books,I miss novels that are written from a single POV and in chronological order. And I'm salty about it.,"Every novel I have read recently (five novels, two by the same author) the story takes disruptive jumps from chapter to chapter. Sometimes the jumps are different characters speaking in the first person, sometimes different points in time or history, sometimes different locations.

Is my experience just coincidence, or does this describe everything being published today? Is this a fad like ""shaky camera"" movies were 20 years ago. Or, worst case, is there a reason writers prefer this approach and it is going to be harder and harder to avoid?

I also wonder if movies and TV have influenced novelists. They tend not to be edited chronologically, either.

I know this is a structure that has been around a long time because I remember being shaken I was when I first encountered Mitchener's The Source and the second story line was introduced after I had completely lost myself in the first, but that turned out amazing.

I first saw the movies and was impressed by them. They are well made entertainment with a lot of heart. I later read the books and found them even better than the movies. The movies breeze past you because they cover a lot in a short span. Whereas the books, without any time and budget restrictions, can go in on much more detail.

I was initially hesitant as an adult to give time to books meant for children and teens but my opinion changed early on. Not only do the books mature as they progress, they are also pretty fun to read. Interestingly, for me the plots and the magic/wizardry were unimpressive. Each book is a mystery where someone is trying to kill or hurt Harry and only Harry and his gang can solve the riddle. The magical aspect is mostly by the number and world building is okay. 

Where the books shine are during the mundane moments in between the bigger, plot-driving moments.

Edit: I believed it to be unpopular since I kind of said they ‘must’ be translated (i.e. compulsory for all copies), apparently I was wrong and most people share this opinion.

books,"Newer dystopians are more story focused, as opposed to older dystopians written for the sake of expressing social commentary in the form of allegory","This is a long thought I’ve had bouncing around my brain juices for a while now

Basically in my reading experiences, it seems older, “classic” dystopians were written for the purpose of making complex ideas more palatable to the public by writing them in the form of easy-to-eat allegorical novels.

Meanwhile, newer dystopian books, while still often social commentary, are written more with “story” and “character” than “allegory” in mind.

Example one- *Animal Farm.* Here is a well thought out, famous short novel that uses farm animals as allegory for the slow introduction of communism into Russia. Now, using farm animals is a genius way of framing a governmental revolution, but the characters are, for lack of a better term, not characters.

What I mean by that is they aren’t written for the reader to care about them. They’re written for the purpose of the allegory, which again, *is not necessarily a bad thing.* The characters accomplish their purposes well, one of many realms *Animal ",10653,0.93,561,0.0037,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c4sd6f/newer_dystopians_are_more_story_focused_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c4sd6f/newer_dystopians_are_more_story_focused_as/

of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the
goal. Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being
free, being open, having no goal. You, O venerable one, are
perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there
are many things you don’t see, which are directly in front of your

books,One of my favorite passages in world literature is this random soldier's death in the *Iliad*,"Then Ajax Telamonios knocked 

down the son of Anthemion, Simoeisios, 

in the full bloom of youth. On the slopes of Ida

descending, by the banks of clear Simoeis, 

his mother had conceived him, while she kept

a vigil with her parents over the flocks; 

he got his name for this. To his dear parents

he never made return for all their care, 

but had his life cut short when Ajax’s shaft

unmanned him. In the lead, as he came on, 

he took the spear-thrust squarely in the chest

beside the nipple on the right side; piercing him, 

the bronze point issued by the shoulder blade, 

and in the dust he reeled and fell. 

A poplar growing in bottom lands, in a great meadow, 

smooth-trunked, high up to its sheath of boughs, 

will fall before the chariot-builder’s ax, ...

and, seasoning, it lies beside the river. 

So vanquished by the god-reared Ajax lay

Simeoisios Anthemides.

books,What I like best about book Jurassic Park and villain John Hammond is that all of his wounds are self-inflicted and can directly be traced back to him trying to save a penny,"Just reread the book for the first time in years, and it really struck me how everything is basically John Hammond’s own fault for trying to save a penny. I’m not talking about his God-complex or inability to recognize that anything bad could possibly happen (although both are major contributors to JP’s downfall). I’m specifically talking about his cost-cutting. The line “We spared no expense” is so iconic that it appears in both the book and the movie, and yet everything that happens at the park is a direct result of John Hammond “sparing the expense.”   
  
1 - It’s mentioned that the staff on the island wanted to install a new dock that would have offered ships greater protection from storms. When a storm comes, the ship is forced to leave early before all their supplies are offloaded because John didn’t want to pay for the more expensive weather-proof dock.

books,We need to stop shaming people who honestly say they don't like a particular book,"I think the most frustrating thing for most readers on this sub is that when they read a book that so many people love and realize they are part of the group that doesn't like the book. They can't share the feeling without having fans hang the noose around them. We muat be able to let readers share their HONEST opinions on a book without riduculing their feelings.

If at this point you are protesting my thoughts thinking they are nothing more than that of unlearned individual. Than I'll share the opinion of a very educated man who has probably read more books than you will ever read in your whole life.

“Books are almost as individual as friends. There is no earthly use in laying down general laws about them. Some meet the needs of one person, and some of another; and each person should beware of the booklover’s besetting sin, of what Mr. Edgar Allan Poe calls ‘the mad pride of intellectuality,’ taking the shape of arrogant pity for the man who does not like the same kind of books.”

I knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man ""falling in love"" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. 

I hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him.

I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery.

For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. 
I also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls!

But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. 

Now, I don’t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. 

So I’m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I’ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn’t capture.

books,Did you know Tolkien was working on a sequel to Lord of the Rings?,"The story was set in the [fourth age](https://screenhub.blog/2022/01/31/unraveling-tolkiens-abandoned-lord-of-the-rings-sequel-the-new-shadow-screenhub-entertainment/) and was going to be about how Men have become too antsy with peace. They began worshiping Sauron, Morgoth and Saruman cult style and children would play ""orc"". It's pretty wild to see where Tolkien's mind was at during this point in his life and how that story would likely work well today, but he ditched it saying it was too dark. I'd love to see the story realized personally.

books,1984 by George Orwell changed my perspective on the way I view modern society and our government. What book has completely changed your perspective on something in any way?,"1984 by George Orwell completely blew my mind when I first read it a few years back.

This book completely changed my perspective on how I view society, as well as, our own government.  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power. In a way, this is not far off from our own government systems, leading me to believe we are not as ""free"" as one would think. 

To this day, my thoughts on these matters have never been the same prior to reading this book.

Many years later, Neil got to talk to her about the book and she said she was absolutely terrified the whole time but wanted to know what was next, so she lied because she was worried that they'd stop reading the book if she said it was terrifying. 

Just think about it... the book got published because a kid lied about how scary it was.

So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP.

I would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.  I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.  I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.  In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. 

I decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.  At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.  In home ",66967,0.89,4100,0.0067,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10nbau4/memphis_grizzlies_scorekeeper_posting_fraudulent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10nbau4/memphis_grizzlies_scorekeeper_posting_fraudulent/

But his Thursday Instagram meme showing three cartoon Spider-Men pointing at each other—one labeled “covid,” one labeled “flu,” one labeled “cold”—with his message: “Help me out folks” was a blow to his worthy legacy. The meme’s implication is that LeBron doesn’t understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that’s been presented in the press. Well, since he asked, let me help him out by explaining the difference—and how knowing that difference might save lives, especially in the Black community.

* I went box score by box score through games Vince Carter played and crossed off players names who played in the same game as him
* Something important to note is that if someone was on the bench but did not play, then it did not count. 
* I did this for all 1541 games in Vinsanity's 21 seasons.

As a former Quarterback he provided great insight as to what play the other team may or may not run, and why. He even predicted quite a few plays. 

What we get for nationally televised NBA games during the Conference Finals and NBA finals from Mark Jackson is nothing short of crap. Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I’m sick of it. He distracts the fans and ruins the experience, especially when it’s a game when there’s so much on the line.

For example, in last night’s game, with Denver up two late, the Lakers had a side-out with 3.2 on the shot clock.  Jackson’s analysis?  “If you’re Denver, you want to make sure LeBron doesn’t get a step-back three.”  Motherfucker, that’s the exact shot Denver had been forcing LeBron to beat them with all series, and he was shooting it poorly all series.

But since Adam Silver and the NBA needs some ideas on how to ""improve"" the All-Star game, here are some of my suggestions for future All-Star games.

- If a player misses a shot, they have to lick Adam Silver's bald head.

- If a player makes a shot, they still have to lick Adam Silver's bald head.

- No more 2 pt shots allowed. Any shot attempt inside the 3 pt line results in an automatic ejection.

- Reduce shot clock to 6 seconds.

- Increase the size of the ball to be bigger than the size of the rim.

- Make LaVar Ball the referee for the game. But give him a microphone and whistle that don't work.

- All players have to wear pink tutus and rollerblades.

- Replace the ball with Kevin Hart.

How bout you guys. Got some ideas to help Adam Silver for next year's All-Star game?

In reality, their life would be exceedingly difficult; they were homeless, they struggled to find work, and they were constantly in fear of deportation as they were unable to acquire full Greek citizenship. They had four children to feed, and often there was not enough to go around. In the worst of times, Giannis and his family would go two or three days without eating.

At 13, Giannis, rail-thin and with no basketball experience, was discovered by a (previously) failed basketball scout. After the scout promised to secure Giannis’ parents with employment, Giannis began playing for a local club and improving his skills. 

Even in this time, Giannis’ family did not have resources, and it was people like cafe owner Giannis Tzikas, who used to give the family sandwiches for free, that kept them afloat.

nba,The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

Yet still, it’s as if they never happened.

What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top 5 player *of his era*, he was never a top 5 player at all.  Not even fucking once. I'm doing this for me.

### Melo, at a glance
* only twice made it out of the first round
* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating

Besides being one of the most exciting players to watch on the court, Ja has been one of the most exciting players to follow off the court this season. 

Seems like he really needs a PR team to follow him around 24/7. From laser pointers to assaulting minors to flashing weapons online, Ja has been very determined to ruin his image as a likeable NBA star.

soccer,PSA - The Sun will now be a banned source on this subreddit.,"&#x200B;

From now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.

The Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.

We firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.

This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.  


We'll update everyone in a few days about the rest of the meta thread, just thought this is worth its own post first as it would obviously dominate the comments, which is understandable.

soccer,Women's Ballon d'Or is a joke and discredits women's soccer.,"We all know that individual trophies are popularity contests, but what happened at Women's Ballon d'Or is absolutely revolting

Megan Rapinoe, who had also won the FIFA prize, famous for her activism, totaled just 339 minutes spread over 6 games by her team, Seattle Reign FC, during the year 2019 having scored 0 goals and 0 assists and being eliminated in the semi-finals  after a 4th place in the regular round.

You can argue that journalists considered that the performance at the World Cup (United States won it) was enough to receive the prize. After all she was the best scorer of the tournament (tied with England's Ellen White and United States Alex Morgan - we'll talk about her) with 6 goals, although 3 of them were penalties and another was scored in the 13- 0 to the amateur selection of Thailand. 

In fact, Rapinoe was only really decisive in the quarter-finals by scoring the 2 goals that won the win against France.


Alex Morgan stood in the 3rd place in the Ballon d'Or also had ",24144,0.88,1220,0.0061,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e6ws7c/womens_ballon_dor_is_a_joke_and_discredits_womens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e6ws7c/womens_ballon_dor_is_a_joke_and_discredits_womens/

For example, in order for my children to play in a good football team, I have to pay $ 3,500 per child. It is not for the figure, but for the whole concept.  I dislike it very much because not everyone has the money needed and the sport should be something for everyone, because it unites people of whatever origin.  Pelé became a champion without anything, he played with a ball made of rags.  Football is the finest sport in the world.”

soccer,[OC] I watched and graded all of Messi’s 800 goals to determine their average quality (and distract myself from my breakup),"Leo Messi is the greatest footballer to ever live. He’s a technical wizard, a world-class passer, an alien goal scoring machine and a remarkably consistent performer. For almost two decades, he’s been banging in ridiculous goals at an absurd clip. Last year, shortly after the World Cup, he passed 800 career senior goals (for Argentina, Barcelona and PSG). 

To me, what separates Messi from someone like Ronaldo, or Haaland, or even Mbappe, (beyond the [playmaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LTfVFNEXYE), which also takes him a level above) are the goals he scores out of absolutely nothing. The goals where he assesses the defense, decides no one can stop him, and singlehandedly (sometimes using a teammate or two) breaks down defenses consisting of grown men who are being paid handsome sums to stop him. 

Anecdotally, I felt (before doing this research) that Messi had scored many goals that no one else on the planet was or is capable of. He also scores an obscene number of goals that",16065,0.94,714,0.0027,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/164cea4/oc_i_watched_and_graded_all_of_messis_800_goals/,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/164cea4/oc_i_watched_and_graded_all_of_messis_800_goals/

soccer,"Hi, I'm Edin Dzeko - striker for AS Roma and Bosnia & Herzegovina. Ask Me Anything!","Hi guys,

Edin Dzeko will be joining us today at around **17:00 Rome time (16:00 UK, 11am EST)** to answer your questions. He might arrive a little earlier, or a little later, depending on when he finishes training.

To allow Edin to get through as many questions as possible, we are opening the thread up now so you can start to submit them. Please keep in mind that, while we will give Edin free rein to answer what he wants as much as possible, this is a Roma AMA and so we will try to focus a fair share of the topics on the Giallorossi!

Dzeko joined Roma in the summer of 2015, and is currently ninth on the list of the club's all-time leading goalscorers. He was Serie A top goalscorer in 2016-17, and last season became the first player to score at least 50 goals in three of Europe's 'Big Five' leagues (Bundesliga, Premier League, Serie A).

You can ask him about that or... well, anything else you can think of really (you all know how this works at this point).

Thanks!

As years have gone by, it’s become too much of a procession/parade than a race for me, not enough space or opportunities to overtake on the circuit, making it more of a team tactics battle rather than a race. I do like the addition of some of the recent circuits such as Singapore and Azerbaijan as they have great opportunities for overtaking with some smart planning on the driver’s part.

We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.","**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After yesterday’s proposal we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

formula1,"We're joining the Reddit blackout from June 12th to 14th, to protest the planned API changes that will kill 3rd party apps","Hey there r/formula1 

One of the less enjoyable mod posts today, but an important one, that we hope you'll take the time to read.

Recently Reddit Inc has announced changes to their API which, if enacted, will shut down many, if not all, 3rd party apps that a large number of Redditors use to access and enjoy their favourite communities - this one included.

One of the most critical changes to the API is that it is moving from a free to a paid model, resulting in expenses that developers of 3rd party apps simply cannot afford. To put the price change in to context, Apollo, one of the most popular 3rd party apps for Reddit, is looking at a cost of $1.7 million per month to continue operating. That's a cost of $12,000 per 50 million API requests. In contrast, Apollo pays Imgur $166 for every 50 million API calls.

This means popular apps like [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), [Reddit Is Fun](https://www.reddit.co",35446,0.92,889,0.002,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/141jtll/were_joining_the_reddit_blackout_from_june_12th/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/141jtll/were_joining_the_reddit_blackout_from_june_12th/

It's like he's saying what he thinks is the right thing to say, instead of saying what he really thinks or feels.""
